with up and down which accessory to modify. When you are in the last row the `Next` button will change to `Finish`.
Press it and continue with the next step.

### Setting up camera and microphone

On this screen you will be greeted by a popup from your browser asking for permissions to use your camera and microphone. For some users this can take a few seconds, but not longer than half a minute. It may not look exactly like the image since this will differ between browsers.

Press `Allow`

With that done you should see the picture of your camera where the crossed out logo of a webcam was. If you have multiple cameras connected you can use the dropdown menu below this box to switch between them.

At the same time you can check if your microphone is working. Below where your camera picture is you can see a bar that indicates if your microphone is picking up any sound. You should see movement when you speak in your microphone or clap infront of it.

Now you can join up with the others by pressing the big blue button labled `Let's go!`

### Small Group Chat (up to 4)

If you wan't to talk to someone just use your arrow keys by pressing the direction you want to go and walk up to them.
When you are standing close enough a small popup wil open in the upper right corner of your browser where you can see
and talk with the person you went up to.

### Big Group Chat

You have to go to one of the rooms scattered around the map. Not all of them work are hooked up
but most of them should be. If you are in such a room, a panel will open from the right of the
browser that loads a group video call. If you wan't to leave that call just walk out of the room.
