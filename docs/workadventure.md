Press it and continue with the next step.

### Setting up camera and microphone

On this screen you will be greeted by a popup from your browser asking for permissions to use your camera and microphone. For some users this can take a few seconds, but not longer than half a minute. It may not look exactly like the image since this will differ between browsers.

Press `Allow`

With that done you should see the picture of your camera where the crossed out logo of a webcam was. If you have multiple cameras connected you can use the dropdown menu below this box to switch between them.

At the same time you can check if your microphone is working. Below where your camera picture is you can see a bar that indicates if your microphone is picking up any sound. You should see movement when you speak in your microphone or clap in front of it.

### Big Group Chat

You have to go to one of the rooms scattered around the map. Not all of them work are hooked up
but most of them should be. If you are in such a room, a panel will open from the right of the
browser that loads a group video call. If you want to leave that call just walk out of the room.

### The Map

The map is composed of a central house and a lot of space around it.
In the areas marked red you can have a conversation with a bigger group, just walk into it.

The blue zone marked `Silent Zone` surpresses any kind of communication, you can go there if you want
to work alone or just have to go to the toilet.

The yellow zone marked `Tutorial` opens this website as a sidepanel.
